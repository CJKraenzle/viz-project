# Why this repository exists

I am currently in a Data Science program at [Worchester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) working on a master's degree.  My current course is CS573 - Data Visualization taught by @curran (:thumbsup:).  We used the text book called "Visualization Analysis & Design" by Tamara Munzner.  Along with the book we have spent time learning how to implement visualization concepts using D3.  This repository contains the code for my final project.
