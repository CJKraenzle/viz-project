# Why this repository exists

I am currently in a Data Science program at [Worchester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) working on a master's degree.  My current course is CS573 - Data Visualization taught by [Curran Kelleher](https://datavis.tech) :thumbsup:.  We used the text book called "Visualization Analysis & Design" by Tamara Munzner.  Along with the book we have spent time learning how to implement visualization concepts using D3.  This repository contains the code for my final project.

# World Happiness Report 

From the [World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/)

> The <i>World Happiness Report</i> is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.  The [World Happiness Report 2017](http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/), which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, will be released today at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness.  The report, the fifth one to come out since 2012, continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.

The World Happiness Report has created a [great video](https://youtu.be/Se2gfFKp1Iw) explaining their mission.

## Data review

I originally started this project using a a smaller data set found on Kaggle.  However, after some more research I found that the [World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/) provides their data under the dowload section, chapter 2.  

The data set ranks 155 countries based on a survey with six key indicators (Income, Health, Social Support, Freedom, generosity, and trustworthy governance).  These indicators are evaluated with the happiness ranking to determine what factors are driving world happiness.  The data in the data set covers 2008 through 2016.  Using the [Voyager tool](http://vega.github.io/voyager/) we created a simple plot showing a key indicator against the happiness rank.

## Visualizations

For this project, the plan is to complete three visualizations.  The first visualization is an overview focused on the happiness ranking.  This visualization will display a world map with color coding to show the ranking.  The goal is to see how specific countries rank their happiness and if there are trends by region.

The second visualization is meant to show change over time.  The goal is to show how a key indicator changes over time and how it impacts overall happiness.  This visualization, is the hardest visualization to date to find the right codings/markings to show change over time for multiple variables.  I will add an image when I settle on the final view of this visualization.

The final view is a detail view showing key indicators over time by country, which allows us to visualize a much smaller set of data.  This chart will simulate the voyager scatter plots but allows filtering by country.

This visualization project will be used for my final visualization project.  This project will create visualizations based on the world happiness report.  Which can be found at http://worldhappiness.report.  Direct link to the data can be found at http://worldhappiness.report/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/online-data-chapter-2-whr-2017.xlsx.
